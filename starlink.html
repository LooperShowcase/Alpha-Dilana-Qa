      <p>Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX,[3] providing satellite Internet access coverage to over 56 countries. It also aims for global mobile phone service after 2023.[4] SpaceX started launching Starlink satellites in 2019. As of May 2023, Starlink consists of over 4,000 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO),[5] which communicate with designated ground transceivers. In total, nearly 12,000 satellites are planned to be deployed, with a possible later extension to 42,000. SpaceX announced reaching more than 1 million subscribers in December 2022[6] and 1.5 million subscribers in May 2023.[7]
        The SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington, houses the Starlink research, development, manufacturing, and orbit control teams. The cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in May 2018 to be at least US$10 billion.[8] SpaceX expects more than $30 billion in revenue by 2025 from its satellite constellation, while revenues from its launch business were expected to reach $5 billion in the same year.[9][10]
        Astronomers have raised concerns about the effect the constellation can have on ground-based astronomy and how the satellites will add to an already congested orbital environment.[11][12] SpaceX has attempted to mitigate astronomy concerns by implementing several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness during operation.[13] The satellites are equipped with krypton or argon-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. Additionally, the satellites are designed to autonomously and smoothly avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.[14]</p>

    <h3>Analyzing How Starlinkâ€™s Low Cost Access Could Help Close the Digital Divide</h3>
    <center>
    <p>As the world moves ever-closer to an all-digital economy, the digital divide remains a major issue in many parts of the world. This divide, which refers to the gap between those with access to internet, technology, and other digital resources, and those without, has been an issue for years. Now, a new initiative from SpaceX, called Starlink, could be the key to closing this divide.

Starlink is a global satellite internet network that plans to provide low-cost access to internet for people in remote areas of the world. The project is currently in its beta stage, and has already seen success in connecting rural areas of the United States and Canada, with plans to expand to other countries.

This low-cost access could be a game-changer for those in remote regions who have been unable to access the internet due to cost or other barriers. By providing access at a lower cost, Starlink could help bridge the digital divide and give people living in these areas the same access to the internet and digital resources as those living in more urban areas</p>
