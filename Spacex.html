      <h3>falcon 9</h3>
      <p>
        Falcon 9 is a partially reusable medium-lift launch vehicle that can
        carry cargo and crew into Earth orbit, designed, manufactured and
        launched by American aerospace company SpaceX. It can also be used as an
        expendable heavy-lift launch vehicle. The first Falcon 9 launch was in
        June 2010. The first Falcon 9 ISS commercial resupply mission to the ISS
        launched on 8 October 2012. In 2020 it became the first commercial
        rocket to ever launch humans to orbit and is currently the only such
        vehicle capable of doing so. It is the only U.S. rocket currently
        certified for transporting humans to the International Space Station. In
        2020, it became the U.S. rocket with the most launches in history and
        with the best safety record, having suffered just one flight
        failure.[20]

      <h3>falcon heavy</h3>
      <p>
        Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle
        that can carry cargo into Earth orbit, and beyond. It is designed,
        manufactured and launched by American aerospace company SpaceX. The
        rocket consists of a center core on which two Falcon 9 boosters are
        attached, and a second stage on top of the center core. Falcon Heavy has
        the second highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch
        vehicle behind NASA's Space Launch System, and the fourth-highest
        capacity of any rocket to reach orbit, trailing behind the SLS, Energia
        and the Saturn V.

      <h3>starship</h3>
      <p>
        Starship is a super heavy-lift space vehicle under development by
        SpaceX. At 120 metres (394 feet) in height and with a liftoff mass of
        5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 pounds), Starship is the largest and most
        powerful rocket ever flown, surpassing the thrust of NASA's Space Launch
        System and Saturn V, as well as the Soviet N1, which had previously held
        the record.[2][3]
